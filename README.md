## BuildingOnAave 

### This project was part of ChaninShot/Alchemy's Bootcamp where a number of contracts were designed to integrate with the AAVE protocol. These contracts integrate concepts of lending, borrowing, flashloans, interest bearing lottery's, collaterol pool's, security techniques, and more. Many of the contracts require inheritance and communication with lending pools, gateways, open zeppelin's standardized token contracts, and other interfaces. All the contracts compile succesfully with truffle.  A list of the contracts that have been designed are as follows...

1. Vanilla Escrow
2. Aave Ether Escrow
3. Aave Dai Escrow
4. Aave Interest Lottery
5. Aave Collateral Pool
6. Aave Flash Voter
